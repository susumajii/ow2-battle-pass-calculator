# Overwatch 2 Battle Pass Calculator

I've modified the original calculator to be more robust and easily updated for future seasons with seasons.js. Credit to sophice for the original calculator which can be found at https://sophice.github.io/ow2-battle-pass-calculator/

* "Projected" finish based on your pace so far
* "Expected" finish based on your plan going forward
* Tracking of both base and prestige tiers, as well as coin earnings
